1.) Let the user save a particular location such that their followers now get that location on their feed and their map (and of course the user themselves too.) 
2.) Machine learning algorithm to recommend locations to a user based on their saves and followings. 
3.) If the user is a new user without any following, then recommend them based on either:

        * Preliminary questions.

	or, 

	* Most sought out locations around the area the user is in based on the app's overall database.
	
	or, 

	* Both.

4.) Searching for users.
5.) What information should the user be prompted to provide when they are saving a location? We have to think about what things are important
    for a person visiting a location:

    	* Subjective level of enjoyment of that user using some metric (what metric though?). This would be more of a tldr than descriptive.
	* Actual descriptive stuff about the location. Stuff like: is this more of a picnic spot?, is this more of a historical spot?, 
	  , is this place clean?, are there restaurants nearby?, is this more of a hiking spot, etc....
	* Maybe a place for the user to write freely about the location rather than being forced to choose certain things.
	* Letting the user add pictures of the place.
	* and more...
