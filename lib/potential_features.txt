I'll firstly work on searching for a user on the app. What factors are important to show relevant users when you enter something in the search field? 
Maybe:
              * The people that they already follow,
	      * Pictures that they have liked,
	      * Locations that they have visited before,
	      * If the user is new, then based on popular users from nearby places and popular users in general.
	      * maybe more...

But how to actually do this? That's what needs to focused on.

==========================================================================================

Potential Features: 

1.) Let the user save a particular location such that their followers now get that location on their feed and their map (and of course the user themselves too.) 
2.) Machine learning algorithm to recommend locations to a user based on their saves and followings. 
3.) If the user is a new user without any following, then recommend them based on either:

        * Preliminary questions.

	or, 

	* Most sought out locations around the area the user is in based on the app's overall database.
	
	or, 

	* Both.

4.) Searching for users.
5.) What information should the user be prompted to provide when they are saving a location? We have to think about what things are important
    for a person visiting a location:

    	* Subjective level of enjoyment of that user using some metric (what metric though?). This would be more of a tldr than descriptive.
	* Actual descriptive stuff about the location. Stuff like: is this more of a picnic spot?, is this more of a historical spot?, 
	  , is this place clean?, are there restaurants nearby?, is this more of a hiking spot, etc....
	* Maybe a place for the user to write freely about the location rather than being forced to choose certain things.
	* Letting the user add pictures of the place.
	* and more...

	How to save current location of the user?

	=> First of all, we have to figure out whether to use "cloud firestore" or "firebase storage." From what I have read,
	   when you need to store relatively large amounts of information and when sharing is involved, it's better to use 
	   "firebase storage." So, I think we'll have to use firebase storage. But maybe it'll be a mixture. 
	   Now, the things needed to be figured out is:
	     1.) How to store location along with all the information related to that location? 
	     2.) How to read the stored location information?
	     3.) How to update a location's information if the user wants to do so?
	     4.) How to delete a location if the user wants to do so? 

	  We have to some kind of CRUD thing. 

	  * One idea is to use UUID to give a unique id to each marker and store the geopoint related to the marker in 
	  firebase with the field name as the UUID. This allows for relatively easy deletion of locations if the user
	  wants to do so. Creation isn't to unituitive, and read and update also shouldn't be too difficult.
